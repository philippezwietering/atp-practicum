/// \brief
/// mark a function declaration as never returning
/// \details
/// This is useful when other code relies a function not to return.
/// It can also enable the compiler to generate slightly better code.
///
/// This must be done by a macro 
/// because Doxygen can't handle __attribute__.
#define HWLIB_NORETURN __attribute__((noreturn))


/// \brief
/// mark a function definition as weak
/// \details
/// This allowed the function definition to be overruled by an 
/// (often application-defined) replacement.
///
/// This attribute also makes it possible to put a function definition
/// in a header, because all but one of the definitions will be 
/// eliminated by the linker.
///
/// This must be done by a macro 
/// because Doxygen can't handle __attribute__.
///
/// MinGW doesn't handle this cvorrectly, hence redefining a weak symbol
/// (as used by the rtos) won't work with MinGW.

/// mark a function definition as to be (always) inlined
/// \details
/// Sometimes a function should always be inlined, for instance
/// because it is called only once, or because inlining it
/// will produce better code.
///
/// Use this attribute with care, because it can lead to much larger
/// code.
///

/// or not should be left to the compiler.
